# AI Operations

## Intelligence Layer
The Intelligence Layer provides functionality to train, test, use, maintain and update analytics and machine learning 
models in the continuum, with the goal of supporting and augmenting the operations and performance
of the security and meta-kernel layers by considering specific policies in the use of data and models, 
with a focus in trustworthiness, including:

- **Intelligence Layer Coordination**: Coordination enables optimization and predictive analytics and 
machine learning models and its use across the continuum. This will include policies for the use, share 
and update of models across the edge-cloud continuum, including federated learning strategies.

- **Data Processing**: Data processing and storage in formats and databases optimized for the application of 
analytics tasks depending on the resources available of the hosting device in the continuum.

- **AI Analytics**: A library of optimized machine learning algorithms for the training and testing of 
predictive and optimization models, including deep learning, adaptive machine learning and reinforcement 
learning libraries optimized to operate in constrained devices. The ICOS Gitlab repository to manage all 
algorithms and libraries employed in the different version of the meta-OS will be maintained, 
such that, depending on the constraint of the device, only the required functionality will be fetched at 
installation or update time.

- **AI Models Marketplace**: A collection of pre-trained analytics and ML models to be reused, updated, 
refined and combined to foster the application of new AI techniques in the 
different layers of the ICOS meta-OS. Functionality to train and compress these models for operation 
in constrained devices will be provided. The models will be stored in the so-called ICOS AI Models Marketplace.

- **Trustworthy AI**: Provide specific algorithms to analyze the models conforming to 
policies for privacy and trustworthiness. Functionality for models to be trained in a federated learning 
fashion to ensure data protection in datasets containing user-specific data will be provided as well as 
explainable AI algorithms to provide reassurance of output of models to the different layers in ICOS.
