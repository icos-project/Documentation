ICOS Administration Guide
=====

**ICOS Meta OS** is a highly distributed system composed of multiple nodes deployed along 
the Cloud-Edge continuum.
A full detailed presentation of the ICOS architecture and its components is available in deliverable 
["D2.2 ICOS Architecture Design (IT-1)"](https://www.icos-project.eu/files/deliverables/D2.2_ICOS_Design_v1.0.pdf).
In order to have a working system, at least one ICOS Controller and one ICOS Agent are needed.
Specifically, the section presents the main requirements and the installation and configuration steps 
to set-up an ICOS system from scratch.
